        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Overview</h3> <!--indepth overview of the project -->
        <p>The project undertaken was to conduct research on the development of computer programming skills within primary school students in years 1-6, and the way in which these skills are taught.
            The research was based on the national computing curriculum, how it is used, the online platforms that support teaching and what the strengths and weaknesses are. As a result, a number of requirements
            for the development of the new platform ('Computing Champions') can be identified. Upon completion of the research, the platform can be designed and built using HTML, CSS and JS. The platform made use of a JS library, AnnYang, to implement voice control which promoted interactivity.</p>

    <section id="research_method"> <!--Description of the research methods undertaken to complete the project-->
        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Methods</h3>
        <p>Throughout the project both qualitative and quantitative data gathering methods were used to gather information to understand the effects of online learning on primary school students and how the shift to online learning has affected their learning interactions.  </p>
        <br>
        <p>The <b>qualitative methods</b> used to gather primary data was questionnaires. Questionnaires were sent to schools that agreed to endorse the project and were circulated amongst junior and senior teaching staff.</p>
        <p>The <b>quantitative methods</b> used to obtain quantifiable data from prospective users. Desk research, a type of quantitative method, was used to gather existing data that will enable the research to become effective. This method also helped to validate the opinions of the platforms in greater detail, as well as to evaluate why those opinions exist.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After each of these mthods were completed, the data gathered was analysed to identify common patterns, opinions and requirements that the new website would perhaps need to adhere to.</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
            <p>Low-Fidelity prototypes were developed to dertermine the potenital layout of the new website. The early sketches of the website were based on ideas which were based on idea, which were then turned into a testable artefact using pen and paper. The benefit of conducting the process was to develop a design/layout that could be a;tered to identify the best option. </p>

        <aside id="high_prototype">
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">High-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
            <p>High-Fidelity prototypes were developed as a presentable alternative to the low-fidelity prototypes. As well as being more presentable to potential users, they provide an in-depth view into what the new site would look like when content is included into the desing. Another benefit to creating these high-fidelity prototypes is the implementation of the chosen colour scheme.</p>
