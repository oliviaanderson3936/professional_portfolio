        <p>The brief provided was to find an item within my household (tailored towards my career) and design and develop a website that sells that single products.
            The website was not to be like the original products website and could only sell this single item. Motion design could also be applied.
            <br>
            The product I chose to sell was a backpack that is perfect for trainee teachers.

        <aside id="low_prototype">
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
            <p>Low-Fidelity prototypes were developed to dertermine the potenital layout of the new website. The early sketches of the website were based on ideas which were based on idea, which were then turned into a testable artefact using pen and paper. The benefit of conducting the process was to develop a design/layout that could be altered to identify the best option. </p>

        <aside id="high_prototype">
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">High-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
            <p>High-Fidelity prototypes were developed as a presentable alternative to the low-fidelity prototypes. As well as being more presentable to potential users, they provide an in-depth view into what the new site would look like when content is included into the desing. Another benefit to creating these high-fidelity prototypes is the implementation of the chosen colour scheme.</p>
