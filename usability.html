        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Overview</h3>
        <p>Total Swimming is an academy that teaches children aged 3-11 how to swim. The developers of the Total Swimming website, Cleversteam, identified that the website had some usability isses.</p>
        <p>The issues are outlined below:</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>User retention</li>
            <li>Sign up rates dwindling via the site</li>
            <li>A number of complaints about the accessibility of the website</li>
            <li>The conversion of users using mobile phones to access the site is low</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>The academy has venues in: Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Cheshire, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. Therefore, there is a need to have a website that has no usability issues and gives users a good experience. The goal of the usability study was to provide Total Swimming with recommendations that could potentially solve some usability issues previously outlined and could improve the interface design.</p>
        <p>The project included a methodology that discusses the usability and data analysis techniques used, what was found and 4 design recommendations that could solve</p>

        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Methodology</h3>
        <p>Throughout the study non-empirical testing was paramount. Non-empirical testing relies on the ability to predict and observe the problems and frustrations that could experience with a website.</p>
        <p>The methodologies used are as followed:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Analytics</li>
            <li>Personas</li>
            <li>Empathy Mapping</li>
            <li>Cognitive Walkthrough</li>
            <li>Heuristic Testing (Lighthouse & WAVE)</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Recommendation 1 - User Retention</h3>
            <p>To increase the user retention on the current site it was recommended to increase the efficiency of the websites performance and page load speed.</p>
            <p>To do this it was recommended to conduct image optimisation and remove redundant elements. Optimising images reduces the file size and in turn increases the speed at which the web pages load. </p>
        </aside>
        <aside id="rec">
            <h3>Recommendation 2 - Sign Up Rates Dwindling via the Site</h3>
            <p>It was recommended to add a ‘Sign Up’ button to the navigation bar to encourage users to sign up and create an account where they will then book and pay for classes. </p>
            <p>Also, the sign up button in the prototype site goes directly to the sign up page which reduces the number of clicks and therefore reduces the chance of confusion.</p>
        </aside>
        <aside id="rec">
            <h3>Recommendation 3 - Accessibility Complaints</h3> 
            <p>The recommendation was for contrasting ratios to be rectified to enable foreground colours to be easily visible and readable on top of the background colours/images.</p>
            <p>Amending the contrast ratios will increase the readability and the usability of the site which as well as increasing the accessibility, will also increase the users retention.</p>
        </aside>
        <aside id="rec">
            <h3>Recommendation 4 - Using Mobiles to Access Site</h3>
            <p>The recommendation was to increase the page load speed to stop any future complaints of the pages interaction being slow. This was done through removing unused CSS, eliminating render blocking resources, serve images in next-gen formats and use properly pre-sized images.</p>
